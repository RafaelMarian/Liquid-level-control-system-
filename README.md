# Liquid-level-control-system-

The project circuit was made in my second year of study. The development of the base electronic design
was made using Orcad. Thus, the project had a clear and simple structure, with a potentiometer for
simulating different levels of water, and a scale for comparing the measured results. To obtain a better
view and an easier level indication, each measurement was highlighted with one LED.
To validate the overall functionality, together with all the possible limitations that my circuit may have, I
went through different types of analysis, like so: DC-Sweep, Temperatures, Worst-Case, Monte Carlo, or
Transient.
Even though the project complexity was not that high, it helped me become more experienced with
hardware circuit development and basic validation procedures.
