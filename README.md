# Liquid Level Control System

This project was developed during the second year of my studies. It involved the design of an electronic circuit using Orcad software. The primary focus was to create a simple and effective system for controlling liquid levels.

## Project Overview

The circuit design included a potentiometer to simulate various water levels, accompanied by a scale to compare and measure the results. Each measurement was clearly visualized using an LED for easier level indication.

## Validation and Analysis

To ensure the functionality and identify potential limitations, various analyses were conducted. These included DC-Sweep, Temperature, Worst-Case, Monte Carlo, and Transient analyses. These tests helped validate the design and provided insights into the circuit's behavior under different conditions.

## Project Outcomes

Although the project's complexity was relatively low, it served as a valuable learning experience in hardware circuit development and basic validation procedures. The simple structure of the system allowed for hands-on experience with practical circuit design and analysis techniques.
